** TODO add continue
Add the possibility to continue from a certain log file and script file

[[file:~/.dotfiles/script/.bin/session_log][file:~/.dotfiles/script/.bin/session_log]]
** TODO add replay
Use ripgrep, uniq, skim and maybe other thing.

The idea would be to have a list of all timestamp entries.
Then when a particular timestamp is selected use it to be the timing and script
file.

Options to choose the speed of the replay
 [[file:~/.dotfiles/script/.bin/session_log][file:~/.dotfiles/script/.bin/session_log]]
** TODO add list and view log
list the log
open in editor
or less, bat, cat the file.

 [[file:~/.dotfiles/script/.bin/session_log][file:~/.dotfiles/script/.bin/session_log]]
